How to use online monitoring scripts

before start:


I - Fluorescence spectroscopy (e.g. C:\Users\Public\fluorescence_spectroscopy)

1. Open 'I_I_start_control.m' in MATLAB.
1.1 Adjust folder path in line 4.

2. Open 'I_II_PARAFAC.m' in MATLAB.
2.1 Adjust folder path in line 2, 7, 10, 34, 83, 108, and 127.
2.2 If needed, adjust the number of base data samples in line 15.

3. Prepare excel/txt files.
3.1 'fingerprints_model6.xlsx' no changes needed.
3.2 'model_data_6.xlsx': to initialize, delete the old 'model_data_6.xlsx', make a copy of 'fingerprints_model6.xlsx' and rename it to 'model_data_6.xlsx'.
3.3 'sak254.txt' value must be 1.
3.4 'sak436.txt' value must be 1.
3.5 'scores.xlsx' should only contain the data of 72 base data samples and header, otherwise delete the rows below (i>72).
3.6 'scores_sak254.xlsx' only values in first row and header, delete rows below. Values for first row: SAK 254 -> 100, Date/Time -> 1, Absorbance in 1/nm -> nan, Sample ID -> nan.
3.7 'scores_sak436.xlsx' only 100 in first row and header, delete rows below.

4. Start 'I_I_start_control.m' in MATLAB


II - Flow cytometry

1. Open 'II_fcm.py' in an environment such as spyder.
1.1 Press 'Run' and follow trough the request process.
1.2 Go until the 'WAIT'. When first flow cytometry measurement is completed, continue by pressing enter.

2. Prepare excel files
2.1 Open 'fcm_results.xlsx' and delete all rows except header.
2.2 Open 'fcm_scores.xlsx' and delete all rows except first and header. Set Default value of -1 at Index column.


III - Dashboard

1. Open 'III_app_online_dashboard.py' in an environment such as spyder and press 'Run'.
1.2 Follow through the request process.
